				<h2>Registered Donee Program</h2>
				<p>
                    <strong>Arizona StRUT donates thousands of computers to hundreds of organizations each year.</strong> Organizations referred to as Donees are either an Arizona public school or an Arizona 501c3 (educational non-profit) organization. Over the past ten years StRUT has donated many types of refurbished computer equipment to these organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have been approved as an Arizona StRUT Donee (eligible for a Standard Computer), you can now take it a step further! As a Registered Donee you can acquire various additional equipment such as laptops, LCD projectors, and flat panel monitors. This annual registration fee starts at $250.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember our Standard Computer Donation is available at no charge to qualified/approved Arizona schools and non-profit organizations. The standard computer is a desktop computer, CRT monitor, keyboard and mouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a qualified Arizona non-profit organization and would like to request refurbished computer equipment from AZStRUT, please complete our Computer Request Form.
                </p>
                <p>
