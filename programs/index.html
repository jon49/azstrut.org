				<h2>Workplace Skills</h2>
				<p>
                	In addition to the technical goals, the AZ StRUT Program addresses a number of "workplace skills" equally integral to the students ability to succeed both personally and in the workplace. These students are often identified as ‘at risk’ because of socioeconomic circumstances, low self-esteem or lack teamwork skills. The majority of students complete the program and leave with experiences in teamwork, accountability and the knowledge that they have valued work skills.

				<h2>AZ StRUT Scholars Program</h2>
				<p>
                	The AZ StRUT Scholars is a newly conceived program which will make it possible for many graduating high school students to take the A+ certification valued by companies hiring employees in the technology area. Often students at the partnering sites cannot afford to pay for these key qualifying examinations and participating schools and training centers do not include the costs in their programs.
                </p>
                <p>
					In addition, the AZ StRUT Scholars Program will also support students who want to continue their technology training at the college level. AZ StRUT supports students' interest in continuing their education as well as finding jobs within the technology industry sector. The AZ StRUT Scholars Program will help to overcome many barriers they currently encounter.
                </p>
                <h4>How can you be involved?</h4>
                <p>
                	This new program is in early stages of funding and is presently able to assist a limited number of students. We welcome companies and organizations that would like to support the AZ StRUT Scholars Program through donations or other support. Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@azstrut.org">info@azstrut.org</a>, or call <strong>(480) 222-4066</strong> for more information about how you can participate.

				<h2>Minor League Techie Camp</h2>
				<p>
                    The AZ StRUT “Minor League Techie” camp is a one-day workshop which teaches pre-high school students how to build a computer while learning valuable workplace skills such as teamwork and problem solving.  Working computers are disassembled prior to class, and with instruction the students reassemble the computers as they learn the role of each component.
